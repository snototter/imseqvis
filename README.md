# Image Sequence Visualizer

TODOs:
* [ ] Switch to a more sophisticated image viewer
* [ ] Implement a stateful viewer (keep zoom & ROI during playback/seek)
* [ ] Allow optional qt/pyside selection

Notes:
* Requires an existing Qt installation  
  Optionally, install either
  ```
  pip install pyqt5
  ```
  or
  ```
  pip install PySide2
  ```
